Compilation instructions
========================
The sources have the following dependencies:

1. Visual Studio 2012

2. MinGW and MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/).
   Please follow the instructions on the MinGW  website to install and setup both tools. Once setup properly, you should be able to run
   the GNU build tool chain from the MSYS shell.

3. Python
   We have tested our scripts on version 2.7.10. You might also need to install the python module psutil. It can be downloaded for the
   appropriate Python version from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil#downloads

   
Compilation:
------------

1) Open the solution file Boogie\Source\Boogie.sln in Visual Studio and compile the sources. A successful build copies all Binaries
into the Boogie\Binaries\ folder.

2) Go to the C50 directory and build the sources from MSYS shell using the commands

   make clean; make all

   After a successful compilation, copy the files c5.0.dt_penalty and c5.0.dt_entropy into the folder Boogie\Binaries\.

Now ICE-* tools should be ready to run from the Boogie\Binaries directory in the same manner as above.
